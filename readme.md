# Inventory Management System (WIP)

Inventory Management System. Currently a CRUD Webapp, with plans to make it decent.

## Installation

To install, simply:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Development

To run, simply run fastapi dev main.py

Try to follow PEP8 (I know I won't)

Go to http://localhost:8000/seed to seed the database.
